Summarization:  The file "pyFakeBk_print_only.py" currently parses through the Master.txt list and narrows it to match the user's input.  In Windows, this would also call a command that would find the specific PDF book (in the same folder or, as i've done in the past, a PDF online) and turn to its exact page.  I cannot currently find a way to this in Mac.  Any ideas would be appreciated.
